# Strict Non-Null Mode

If you compile your code with `--enable-experimental-non-null` the Vala compiler will run in strict non-null type checking mode and consider *every* type to be not nullable by default unless it is explicitly declared nullable by marking it with a question mark: 

```vala
Object o1 = new Object();     // not nullable
Object? o2 = new Object();    // nullable
```

The compiler will perform a static compile-time analysis to ensure that no nullable reference is assigned to a non-nullable reference, e.g. this won't be possible: 

```vala
o1 = o2;
```
*o2* could be *null* and *o1* was declared non-nullable, so this assignment is forbidden. However, you can override this behaviour with an explicit non-null cast if you're sure that *o2* is not *null*: 

```vala
o1 = (!) o2;
```

The strict non-null mode helps in avoiding unwanted *null* dereferencing errors. This feature would come to full potential if the nullability of all return types in bindings was marked correctly, which is currently not always the case.
