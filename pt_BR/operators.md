# Operators

    =

assignment. The left operand must be an identifier, and the right must result in a value or reference as appropriate. 

    +, -, /, *, %

basic arithmetic, applied to left and right operands. The `+` operator can also concatenate strings. 

    +=, -=, /=, *=, %=

arithmetic operation between left and right operands, where the left must be an identifier, to which the result is assigned. 

    ++, --

increment and decrement operations with implicit assignment. These take just one argument, which must be an identifier of a simple data type.

The value will be changed and assigned back to the identifier. These operators may be placed in either prefix or postfix positions - with the former the evaluated value of the statement will be the newly calculated value, with the latter the original value is returned. 

    |, ^, &, ~, |=, &=, ^=

bitwise operations: or, exclusive or, and, not. The second set include assignment and are analogous to the arithmetic versions. These can be applied to any of the simple value types. (There is of no assignment operator associated with `~` because this is a unary operator. The equivalent operation is just `a = ~a`). 

    <<, >>

bit shift operations, shifting the left operand a number of bits according the right operand. 

    <<=, >>=

bit shift operations, shifting the left operand a number of bits according the right operand. The left operand must be an identifier, to which the result is assigned. 

    ==

equality test. Evaluates to a `bool` value dependent on whether the left and right operands are equal. In the case of value types this means their values are equal, in the case of reference types that the objects are the same instance. An exception to this rule is the `string` type, which is tested for equality by value. 

    <, >, >=, <=, !=

inequality tests. Evaluate to a `bool` value dependent on whether the left and right operands are different in the manner described. These are valid for simple value data types, and the `string` type. For strings these operators compare the lexicographical order. 

    !, &&, ||

logic operations: not, and, or. These operations can be applied to Boolean values - the first taking just one value the others two. 

    ? :

ternary conditional operator. Evaluates a condition and returns either the value of the left or the right sub-expression based on whether the condition is true or false: *condition* `?` *value if true* `:` *value if false* 

    ??

null coalescing operator: `a ?? b` is equivalent to `a != null ? a : b`. This operator is useful for example to provide a default value in case a reference is *null*: 


```vala
stdout.printf("Hello, %s!\n", name ?? "unknown person");
```

    in

checks if the right operand contains the left operand. This operator works on arrays, strings, collections or any other type that has an appropriate *contains()* method. For strings it performs a substring search. 

Operators cannot be overloaded in Vala. There are extra operators that are valid in the context of lambda declarations and other specific tasks - these are explained in the context they are applicable.
