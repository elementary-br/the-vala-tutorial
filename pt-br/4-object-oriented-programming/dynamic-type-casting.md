# Dynamic Type Casting

For the dynamic cast, a variable is casted by a postfix expression `asÂ DesiredTypeName`. Vala will include a runtime type checking to ensure this casting is reasonable - if it is an illegal casting, `null` will be returned. However, this requires both the source type and the target type to be referenced class types. 

For example, 

```vala
Button b = widget as Button;
```

If for some reason the class of the `widget` instance is not the Button class or one of its subclasses or does not implement the Button interface, `b` will be `null`. This cast is equivalent to: 

```vala
Button b = (widget is Button) ? (Button) widget : null;
```
