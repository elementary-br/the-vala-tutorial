# Code Attributes

Code attributes instruct the Vala compiler details about how the code is supposed to work on the target platform. Their syntax is
`[AttributeName]` or `[AttributeName(param1 = value1, param2 = value2, ...)]`.

They are mostly used for bindings in *vapi* files, `[CCode(...)]` being the most prominent attribute here.

Another example is the `[DBus(...)]` attribute for exporting remote interfaces via [D-Bus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus).
