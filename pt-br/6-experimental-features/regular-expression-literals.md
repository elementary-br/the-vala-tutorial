# Regular Expression Literals

[Regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) are a powerful technique for pattern matching in strings. Vala has experimental support for regular expression literals (`/regex/`). Example: 

```vala
string email = "tux@kernel.org";
if (/^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/i.match(email)) {
    stdout.printf("Valid email address\n");
}
```

The trailing *i* makes the expression case insensitive. You can store a regular expression in a variable of type *Regex*: 

```vala
Regex regex = /foo/;
```

A example of regular expression replacement: 

```vala
var r = /(foo|bar|cow)/;
var o = r.replace ("this foo is great", -1, 0, "thing");
print ("%s\n", o);
```

The following trailing characters can be used: 

-   *i*, letters in the pattern match both upper- and lowercase letters
    
-   *m*, the "start of line" and "end of line" constructs match immediately following or immediately before any newline in the string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end.

-   *s*, a dot metacharater *.* in the pattern matches all characters, including newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded.

-   *x*, whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class.
