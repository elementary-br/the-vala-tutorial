# Non-Object classes

Classes defined as not being descended from *GLib.Object* are treated as a special case. They are derived directly from GLib's type system and therefore much lighter in weight. In a more recent Vala compiler, one can also implement interfaces, signals and properties with these classes. 

One obvious case of using these non-*Object* classes stays in the GLib bindings. Because GLib is at a lower level than GObject, most classes defined in the binding are of this kind. Also, as mentioned before, the lighter weight of non-object classes make them useful in many practical situations (e.g. the Vala compiler itself). However the detailed usage of non-*Object* classes are outside the scope of this tutorial. Be aware that these classes are fundamentally different from structs.
